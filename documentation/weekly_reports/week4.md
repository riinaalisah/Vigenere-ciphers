## Week 4 report

#### Work hours
5h

#### What I did

##### Monday 1st of April
- encryption to its own class
- fixes to Keyed Vigen√®re
- started working on FileHandler class, should work now ok

##### Thursday 4th of April
- decryption
- updating UI
- creating test files for testing

##### Friday 5th of April
- implementation document
- start of testing document
- adding comments to code


#### Problems, difficulties etc.
I realised that there are still some problems with reading a file (ends too early if there are bigger
 gaps/spaces/row changes in the text) but it will be easy to fix. Otherwise everything seems fine.

#### What next
- Continuing with own implementations (ArrayList, charToArray etc)
- Making sure different kinds of texts can be read correctly
- Figuring out how to make encryption/decryption case sensitive
