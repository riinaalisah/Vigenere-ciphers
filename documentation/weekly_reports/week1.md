## Week 1 report

##### Work hours
2h

##### What I did
- Creating the project (git)
- first nonograms and their solutions in text files
- research on the subject
- writing the specification document.
 
 
##### Problems, difficulties etc.
- At this point the project feels quite difficult and there are a lot of new things to learn.
Honestly I feel quite overwhelmed but I hope everything gets more clear as the weeks go on and the course
 Ohjelmistotekniikka continues on the side.

##### What next?
- more research (getting ideas, learning how to make a java project)
- ask for help if needed
- start working on the algorithms (simple algorithm first)
