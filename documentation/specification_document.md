## Specification Document (Määrittelydokumentti)

The nonogram solver is an application that can solve nonograms with different algorithms. 

##### Algorithms, Data Structures and Time Complexity
The aim for the project is to create at least two different algorithms for solving nonograms: one simple and one more
 complex. The simple algorithm can solve small and easy nonograms and the more complex algorithm can solve larger
  and more difficult nonograms. The aim for the algorithms is to be able to solve nonograms in O(2n) time at most.
  
  
##### Input and Output
Input: The application is given a nonogram in a text file with the nonogram's width, height and numbers for each row
 and column. 

Output: Progress of solution, solved nonogram, time used.
